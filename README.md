# NetRoute-Implementation-and-Comparitive-Study
In today's modern world, where data flows easily and seamlessly between devices and systems, efficient network routing plays a crucial role in data communication.​

This project relies on two fundamental elements i.e., data and algorithm used. The data is taken in the form of text files which is structured in a graph and then different path finding algorithms are used over the data.​
​
The project attempts to create a network routing system that not only finds the optimal or near-to-optimal path but also compares different approaches used by different algorithms for efficient and optimal solutions.​
